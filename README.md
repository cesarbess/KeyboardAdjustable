KeyboardAdjustable takes into account the two most common ways we adjust our view when the keyboard appears:

* When you have a ScrollView and you want to change its contentInset when the keyboard appears
* When you have a bottom constraint for a UIView and you want to change itâ€™s value when the keyboard appears

With only one line of code you'll be able to handle these scenarios without having to implement the observers in your own UIViewController.

## How to use:

1. Import KeyboardAdjustable on your UIViewController file
2. Add the KeyboardAdjustable protocol to your UIViewController 
3. Setup a KeyboardAdjustingStrategy on your viewDidLoad

Note:
Make sure you're calling `registerForKeyboardNotifications()` on your viewDidLoad and `unregisterForKeyboardNotification()` on your viewDidDisappear.

## Example

```
class SingleConstraintViewController: UIViewController, KeyboardAdjustable {

    var keyboardAdjustingStrategy: KeyboardAdjustingStrategy?

    @IBOutlet weak var bottomConstraint: NSLayoutConstraint!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Register for keyboard notifications
        registerForKeyboardNotifications()
        
        // Set your desired strategy to adjust the view when the keyboard appears
        self.keyboardAdjustingStrategy = .singleConstraint(
                                          constraint: bottomConstraint, 
                                          originalConstant: bottomConstraint.constant,
                                          spaceAboveKeyboard: 20)
    }

    override func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidDisappear(animated)
        // Unregister for keyboard notifications
        unregisterForKeyboardNotification()
    }
}
```
